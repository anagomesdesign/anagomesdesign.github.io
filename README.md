Hello there!

I'm a Brazilian Product Designer currently based in Canada. I have +10 years of experience working with design, user experience, and technology. In my spare time, I love playing video games, drinking coffee, and exploring the outdoors.

Currently, I work as a Senior Product Designer for Spud and in the past, I worked with companies like [SkipTheDishes](https://www.skipthedishes.com/?utm_source=anagomesdesign&utm_medium=web&utm_id=github), [Ubisoft](https://winnipeg.ubisoft.com/?utm_source=anagomesdesign&utm_medium=web&utm_id=github), and [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/ca?utm_source=anagomesdesign&utm_medium=web&utm_id=github).
